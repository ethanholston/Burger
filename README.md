# Burger

Burger ORM is a full stack application. It displays burgers that are available to eat, simply click the button to devour it! If you want to revive a burger that has been devoured, find it in the 'Burger Graveyard' and click the button 'Make Another'. This will make the burger available to eat again. Don't see the burger you want to eat? Add a burger using the form at the bottom of the page. 

To start the application locally, navigate to the application's directory and run 'npm install' and once that completes run 'npm start'. Navigate in your web browser to http://localhost:8080. 

A live version of the application is also available on Heroku: https://burger-orm-.herokuapp.com
